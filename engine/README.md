# Flutter Engine

## `gclient` bootstrap

Flutter engine uses `gclient` to manage dependencies.

If you've already cloned the flutter repository:

1. Copy one of the `engine/scripts/*.gclient` to the root folder
2. run `gclient sync`

If you haven't cloned the repository; you could copy the sample gclient file
to an empty directory and use `gclient sync`.
